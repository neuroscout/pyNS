**pyNS** is a python library to easily interact with the Neuroscout API.

**pyNS** enables advanced used cases not supported by the [neuroscout.org](https://neuroscout.org>)
web-based analysis builder, such as batch-creation of analyses, meta-analytic applications, as well as supporting the operations of the [neuroscout-cli](github.com/neuroscout/neuroscout-cli/)
